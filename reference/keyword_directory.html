    <tr>
      <th>directory</th>
      <td><p>The directory to perform the search for pdf files to search.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>keyword</th>
      <td><p>The keyword(s) to be used to search in the text. Multiple 
keywords can be specified with a character vector.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>split_pdf</th>
      <td><p>TRUE/FALSE indicating whether to split the pdf using white 
space. This would be most useful with multicolumn pdf files. 
The split_pdf function attempts to recreate the column layout of the text 
into a single column starting with the left column and proceeding to the 
right.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>surround_lines</th>
      <td><p>numeric/FALSE indicating whether the output should 
extract the surrouding lines of text in addition to the matching line. 
Default is FALSE, if not false, include a numeric number that indicates 
the additional number of surrounding lines that will be extracted.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>ignore_case</th>
      <td><p>TRUE/FALSE/vector of TRUE/FALSE, indicating whether the 
case of the keyword matters. 
Default is FALSE meaning that case of the keyword is literal. If a vector, 
must be same length as the keyword vector.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>remove_hyphen</th>
      <td><p>TRUE/FALSE indicating whether hyphenated words should
be adjusted to combine onto a single line. Default is TRUE.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>token_results</th>
      <td><p>TRUE/FALSE indicating whether the results text returned
should be split into tokens. See the tokenizers package and 
<code><a href='convert_tokens.html'>convert_tokens</a></code> for more details. Defaults to TRUE.</p></td>

    <tr>
      <th>convert_sentence</th>
      <td><p>TRUE/FALSE indicating if individual lines of PDF file
should be collapsed into a single large paragraph to perform keyword 
searching. Default is TRUE.</p></td>

      <th>remove_equations</th>
      <td><p>TRUE/FALSE indicating if equations should be removed.
Default behavior is to search for the following regex:
"\([0-9]1,\)$", essentially this matches a literal parenthesis,
followed by at least one number followed by another parenthesis at
the end of the text line. This will not detect other patterns or
detect the entire equation if it is a multi-row equation.</p></td>

PDF files using <code><a href='https://rdrr.io/pkg/stringi/man/stri_split.html'>stringi::stri_split_regex</a></code>. 
Default pattern is "\pWHITE_SPACE3," which can be interpreted as: 
split based on three or more consecutive white space characters.</p></td>

    <tr>
      <th>full_names</th>
      <td><p>TRUE/FALSE indicating if the full file path should be used.
Default is TRUE, see <code><a href='https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.files.html'>list.files</a></code> for more details.</p></td>

#&gt; 7                                                                                                                                   It does not make sense to alter every individual’s reported values in the survey, as would be done using a conditional independence approach. , In this article, we develop a framework for leveraging information from gold stan- dard data to improve inferences in surveys subject to measurement errors. , The basic idea is to encode plausible assumptions about the error process, e.g., most people do not make errors when reporting educational attainments, and the reporting process, e.g., when people make errors, they are more likely to report higher attainments than actual, into statistical models.

#&gt; 13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Of the individuals in the NSCG who had at least a college degree at the time of the 1990 census, about 93.3% of them have the same contemporaneous education levels in both files. , This suggests that most people report correctly, an observation we want to leverage when constructing measurement error models for education in the 2010 ACS. , In most situations, we do not have the good fortune of observing individuals’ error- prone and true values simultaneously. 
#&gt; 14                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Additionally, DE can include variables for which there is no corresponding variable in DG . , These variables do not play a role in the measurement error modeling, although they can be used in multiple imputation inferences. , We seek to estimate Pr(Y, Z | X), and use it to create multiple imputations for the missing values in Y for the individuals in DE . 
#&gt; 15                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Using E enables us to write Pr(Y, Z | X) as a product of three sub-models. , For individual i, the full data likelihood (omitting parameters for simplicity) can be factored as Pr(Yi = k, Zi = l | Xi ) = Pr(Yi = k | Xi ) This separates the true data generation process and the measurement error generation process, which facilitates model specification. , In particular, we can use DG to estimate the true data distribution Pr(Y | X).

#&gt; 17                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             This is akin to diagnostics in multiple imputation for missing data that compare imputed and observed values (Abayomi et al., 2008). , When these distributions differ substantially, it suggests the measurement error model specification (or possibly the true data model) is inadequate. , Such diagnostic checks only can reveal problems with the model specification; they do not indicate that a particular specification is correct.

#&gt; 21                                                                                                                             Instead, we estimate Tx+ = Tx1 + Tx2 + Tx3 + Tx4 + Tx5 using the ACS data, and estimate (Tx1 , Tx2 , Tx3 , Tx4 ) from the NSCG using the method described previously; this leads to an estimate for Tx5 . , More precisely, let the ACS design-based estimator for Tx+ T̂xk wi I(Xi = x, Yi = k) − nG − 1 i=1 T̂xl µxj = log(T̂xj ) − τx [j, j]/2 τx [j, j] = log 1 + Σ̂x [j, j]/(T̂xj  ) τx [j, i] = log 1 + Σ̂x [j, i]/(T̂xj · T̂xi ) , wi I(Xi = x, Yi = l) − Table 2: Summary of the first four measurement error model specifications for 2010 NSCG/ACS analysis. , These models use flat prior distributions on all parameters.

#&gt; 23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            In Model 4, the error and reporting models both depend on Y and sex. , For Models 5 – 7, we use the specification in Model 4 and incorporate prior in- formation about the measurement errors from the 1993 linked data. , In constructing the priors, we first remove records that have been flagged as having missing education that has been imputed, because these imputations might not closely reflect the actual education values (Black et al., 2003). 
#&gt; 24                                                                                                                                                                      It seems plausible that the probability of misreporting education, as well as the reported value itself when errors are made, depend on both sex and true education level. , Additionally, the prior distribution from the 1993 linked data pulls estimates in groups with little sample size to measurement error distributions that seem more plausible on face value. , However, one need not use the data fusion framework for measurement error to select a single model; rather, one can use the framework to examine sensitivity of analyses to the different specifications.
